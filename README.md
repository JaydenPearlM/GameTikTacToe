# TiktacToe

Working on my TicTacToe game taught me a lot about programming with Java. I learned how to use Object-Oriented Programming to create and manage the game board using a 2D array. I also developed skills in handling game logic, such as checking for wins and making sure each move was valid. This project helped me practice writing clean and reusable code and improve my problem-solving abilities. Overall, it was a great experience that strengthened my programming foundation and prepared me for more advanced projects.
